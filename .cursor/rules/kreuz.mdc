This project should use TypeScript where it can replace JavaScript. This is for a browser-based game
set in a dwarven-like underground colony. The map is made up of square terrain tiles that are either
an excavated space, or not. Excavated tiles are used by the NPCs as tunnels or rooms. When seen from
above you can see the floor of it, which is made of different materials: dirt, wood, pebbles,
stones, concrete slab Unexcavated tiles are unknown, mysterious. They are made of different
materials: granite, limestone, clay, dirt.

There may be other objects in the map.

The game is populated by entities in an ECS architecture. The ECS components that are associated
with an ECS entity decide what the entity actually is, and what's interesting about them. All ECS
components are defined in `src/game/core/ecs/components/`.

The game instance is usually called simply `game` and contains all the stable API to interact with
entities, events and so on.

Code style:

-   Most React components should have Storybook stories.
-   All React components, classes, class methods and public properties must have TSDoc
    documentation.
-   All functions that emit an event should document which event and when.

Although this code is open-sourced, it is not open-licensed. I probably would license it to you
if you [submit an issue for it](https://github.com/wvbe/kreuzzeug-im-nagelhosen/issues/new),
and probably won't if you don't.

In other words, you are not allowed to use this code in any way, unless you have my written
permission.

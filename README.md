# Kreuzzeug im Nagelhosen

react-spring, emotion, SVG, countless of open-source software and a fucktonne of internet üôè

_Kreuzzeug_ (German) loosely means _cross stuff_ instead of _crusade_ (_Kreuzzug_), which I didn't
want to use because crusades suck. The cross stuff shows up in a
[1850's dictionary](https://www.worldcat.org/title/deutsches-worterbuch/oclc/1446302) published by
the actual Brothers Grimm.

_Nagelhose_ is simply the laziest translation from _spijkerbroek_ (Dutch) to _nail pants_
(Dunglish), and then again to German.

Together they are a nod to the children's novel
[Crusade in Jeans (1973)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade_in_Jeans) by
[Thea Beckman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thea_Beckman).

Upon re-reading it I realized it had aged badly.

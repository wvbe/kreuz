# Kreuzzeug im Nagelhosen

_Kreuzzeug_ (German) loosely means _cross stuff_ instead of _crusade_ (_Kreuzzug_), which I didn't
want to use because crusades suck. The cross stuff shows up in a
[1850's dictionary](https://www.worldcat.org/title/deutsches-worterbuch/oclc/1446302) published by
the actual Brothers Grimm.

_Nagelhose_ is simply the laziest translation from _spijkerbroek_ (Dutch) to _nail pants_
(Dunglish), and then again to German -- with a capital letter because [that's how the Germans
do](https://www.thegermanproject.com/german-lessons/nouns#:~:text=You%20might%20have%20noticed%20something,
place%2C%20and%20thing%20is%20capitalized.).

Together they are a nod to the children's novel
[Crusade in Jeans (1973)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade_in_Jeans) by
[Thea Beckman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thea_Beckman).

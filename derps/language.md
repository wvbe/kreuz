## Naming Style Counsel

_UX wisdom in a peasant's coat_

-   Keep words short and stout. One to three beats be best: Make Fast, Lay Snare, Raise Hut.
-   Bind like to like. All build-things start with a deed: Raise Shelter, Raise Rack, Raise Post.
-   Let the ear learn the rhythm. Use the same shapes for states: Hungry/Full-fed, Parched/Slaked.
-   Put the need first. In lists: Water, Fire, Food, Shelter afore fancy.
-   Spare the purple. A little color sweetens, too much cloys. Let warnings be plain.
